abstract = {Semantic-based segmentation (Semseg) methods play an essential part in medical imaging analysis to improve the diagnostic process. In Semseg technique, every pixel of an image is classified into an instance, where each class is corresponded by an instance. In particular, the semantic segmentation can be used by many medical experts in the domain of radiology, ophthalmologists, dermatologist, and image-guided radiotherapy. The authors present perspectives on the development of an architectural, and operational mechanism of each machine learning-based semantic segmentation approach with merits and demerits. In this regard, researchers have proposed different Semseg methods and examined their performance in a variety of applications such as medical image analysis (e.g., medical image classification and segmentation). A review of recent advances in Semseg techniques are presented in this paper by applying computational image processing and machine learning methods. This article is further presented a comprehensive investigation on how different architectures are helpful for medical image segmentation. Finally, advantages, open challenges, and possible future directions are elaborated in the discussion part, beneficial to the research community to understand the significance of the available medical imaging segmentation technology based on Semseg and thus deliver robust segmentation solutions.},

abstract = {In recent years, large amount of high spatial-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) images are available for land-cover mapping. However, due to the complex information brought by the increased spatial resolution and the data disturbances caused by different conditions of image acquisition, it is often difficult to find an efficient method for achieving accurate land-cover classification with high-resolution and heterogeneous remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a scheme to apply deep model obtained from labeled land-cover dataset to classify unlabeled HRRS images. The main idea is to rely on deep neural networks for presenting the contextual information contained in different types of land-covers and propose a pseudo-labeling and sample selection scheme for improving the transferability of deep models. More precisely, a deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is first pre-trained with a well-annotated land-cover dataset, referred to as the source data. Then, given a target image with no labels, the pre-trained CNN model is utilized to classify the image in a patch-wise manner. The patches with high confidence are assigned with pseudo-labels and employed as the queries to retrieve related samples from the source data. The pseudo-labels confirmed with the retrieved results are regarded as supervised information for fine-tuning the pre-trained deep model. To obtain a pixel-wise land-cover classification with the target image, we rely on the fine-tuned CNN and develop a hybrid classification by combining patch-wise classification and hierarchical segmentation. In addition, we create a large-scale land-cover dataset containing 150 Gaofen-2 satellite images for CNN pre-training. Experiments on multi-source HRRS images, including Gaofen-2, Gaofen-1, Jilin-1, Ziyuan-3, Sentinel-2A, and Google Earth platform data, show encouraging results and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme to land-cover classification with multi-source HRRS images.},

abstract = {Jordan is witnessing major transformations in its environmental and topographic features, where the desert dominates a large part of the territory, with very limited forest areas. Over the last three decades, Jordan has lost about a third of its natural forests at an annual rate of 1.6%. In this study, we develop a deep learning model to automatically monitor deforestation in Jordan based on the semantic segmentation of multitemporal Landsat-8 satellite images. Very few studies and datasets are devoted to monitoring forest cover changes using semantic image segmentation with deep neural networks. Therefore, we have collected a new benchmarking dataset of Jordanian forests between 2010 and 2020. The proposed model includes an efficient encoder-decoder architecture, with which we can extract a set of discriminating features that semantically assign every key image pixel into either forest or non-forest classes. The deep architecture is first initialised by a CNN-based pre-trained model and then it is fine-tuned on the forest images through an effective transfer learning procedure to improve its generalisation ability. Then, a set of key features are extracted by encoding each forest image into low-dimensional semantic maps to formulate the generic descriptors used in image segmentation. Finally, the output of the segmentation process is used to detect any dissimilarity in the forest area or boundaries using an absolute pixel-pixel similarity check over many years. The experimental results proved the effectiveness of the proposed model in segmenting the forest images and predicting any loss (deforestation) or gain (reforestation), and the model achieved an accuracy of 94.8% and MIoU of 82.1%. Moreover, the deep semantic features are discriminative enough to efficiently identify and estimate the amount of deforestation change in terms of accuracy and computational resources.},
