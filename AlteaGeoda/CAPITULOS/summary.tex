\chapter*{Summary}
Vegetation encroachment on high-voltage power lines poses a critical risk to energy infrastructure, with potential consequences including power outages and wildfire ignition. This project focuses on vegetation control through remote sensing (satellite imagery analysis) in the Cantabria region, with the objective of detecting risk zones where vegetation may potentially come into contact with power lines. To achieve reliable results, four convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures were implemented and evaluated for the task of forest segmentation. Based on a comparative evaluation, DeeplabV3+ was found to outperform the other models in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC. This architecture was therefore selected and applied to generate detailed forest segmentation maps of Cantabria, which were subsequently used to identify and analyze potential vegetationâ€“power line interaction zones.
